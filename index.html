    <div class="topicStyle">We were all thinking it, but which of these fictional characters said it so eloquently? </div>
    <div class="questionStyle">Select the wordsmith behind each quote. Was it Donaghy, Lucille, Cartman, or Trump? Reveal a golden toilet and you're smart enough to be president. Otherwise, brush up, simpleton... what are you, a farmer? Hover your mouse over a character's name to learn more, or hit the money to begin.</div><br>
    <div class="info-line">
      <div class="info">&#9432 DONAGHY<span>Ah, Jack Donaghy. Star of 30 Rock, head of NBC, and former VP of Microwave Oven Programming. The self-assured businessman is part of the political and economic elite that you know nothing about.</span></div>
      <div class="info">&#9432 LUCILLE<span>The queen herself, Lucille Bluth. Star of Arrested Development, husband to George Sr., and mother of four. She's proud of her status. Off-put by immigrants.  </span></div>
      <div class="info">&#9432 CARTMAN<span class="right">This is Cartman. You may recognize him from South Park. He's a foul-mouth fourth grader. Perpetually insecure and yet refreshingly opinionated. Don't get him started on hippies.</span></div>
      <div class="info">&#9432 TRUMP<span class="right">Star of The Apprentice. Running for president. "He actually has some really good points," says your drunk uncle. Thank god he's imaginary.</span></div><br>
